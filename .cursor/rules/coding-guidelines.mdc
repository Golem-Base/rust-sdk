- Don't use fully qualified paths. Import symbols properly instead. Only exceptions: anyhow::Result, log, serde_json
- Prefer resusing functions instead of generating and duplicating code
- When modifying code, always consider my selection over general context
- Don't write junior comments. Don't describe what next line does, what can be directly understood from code. Comments should explain why the specific solution was chosen.
- Never implement Default, Clone, Debug, Display unless asked. Never remove existing derives on structs.
- Don't use Debug prints and logs if possible.
